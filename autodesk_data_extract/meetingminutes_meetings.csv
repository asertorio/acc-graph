Welcome &amp; Purpose • Objective: close outstanding design items ahead of the IFC package freeze. &nbsp;2. Architectural Updates • Façade rhythm revision – bay width increased 3m → 3.3m; mock-ups accepted. • Stair-core optimisation – 150mm wall-thickness reduction adds ≈ 5m² NLA per floor. • Interior finishes – lobby stone and carpet tile selections endorsed. &nbsp;Actions: - Issue Rev D GA drawings and updated façade schedule by 02 Aug 2025 - Incorporate stair-core reduction and finishes into model by 12 Aug 2025 &nbsp;3. Structural Coordination • Transfer beam – 900mm-deep, 50MPa beam clears services zone by 75mm. • Wet-area set-downs – 40mm recess standardised; waterproofing warranty confirmed. • Seismic restraint – Category B building importance; no extra façade bracing required. &nbsp;Actions: - Provide preliminary transfer-beam shop drawings by 05 Aug 2025 - Confirm procurement lead-time for 50MPa concrete mix by 06 Aug 2025 &nbsp;4. Building Services (MEP) • Riser consolidation – data &amp; small-power risers merged (lvls 8–12), eliminating one shaft. • HVAC diffuser clashes – diffusers to shift 150mm to clear new mullions. • Fire-sprinkler layout – 12 heads clash with pendant lights; rerouting required. &nbsp;Actions: - Update MEP model and re-issue by 04 Aug 2025 &nbsp;5. Digital / BIM Coordination • Navisworks federation updated (Arch Rev D draft, Struct Rev C, MEP Rev B). • Clash matrix: 27 high-priority clashes remain (down from 61). • Decision: activate ACC Design Collaboration for real-time model sharing. &nbsp;Actions: - Upload clash-free federated model to ACC Design Collaboration workspace by 03 Aug 2025</p>",open,2,,2025-07-25 00:00:00,60,https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_NzRlMTE0ZWYtYjViMi00ZjhkLTk0MGEtNTk2OWJmYmUyZWRm%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2267bff79e-7f91-4433-a8e5-c9252d2ddc1d%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22065776b3-ac80-4082-aef7-722b0e1d6573%22%7d,7VZ2Q8PTMR3E7H96,7VZ2Q8PTMR3E7H96,2025-10-07 07:11:54,2025-10-07 07:18:15,
